# Automated Data Entry System Development with UiPath

## Introduction

This repository holds the UiPath `.xaml` file for a project titled "Automated Data Entry System Development," which was developed with a focus on robotic process automation (RPA) techniques.

## Project Duration

January 2024 - February 2024

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to engineer a comprehensive workflow framework within UiPath to significantly enhance the efficiency of data entry tasks. By automating routine operations, the time required for data processing tasks was reduced from an hour to an impressive 3 minutes.

## Features

- **Workflow Efficiency**: The project introduces a robust automated system that reduces data entry time significantly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface was created to facilitate user interaction, allowing data entry completion with a single mouse click.
- **Integration with SAP systems**: Leveraging on SAP and other enterprise systems can be developed to ensure seamless integration of automated processes with existing business operations in the future.
- **Customization**: The framework supports custom development, providing tailored automation solutions to meet specific business needs.

## Outcomes

- The automation reduced the number of user interactions from over 100 clicks and various typing inputs to just one click.
- It showcases the potential for RPA to transform business operations by saving time and reducing the potential for human error.

## How to Use

To use the workflows in this repository:

1. Download the `.xaml` files.
2. Open the files in UiPath Studio.
3. Execute the main automation workflow or inspect individual components for educational purposes.
